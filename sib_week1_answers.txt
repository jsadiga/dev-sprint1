**What is a route, and how do you specify one in Flask?
ANS:routes redirect user to intended function/location based on URL. @app.route('')

**What is the only route we’ve specified in our application?
ANS:@app.route('/')

**What is the method that gets called when we hit that route?
ANS:hello_world()

**If I wanted to add a route at “/world” that printed “Hello, ANS:World” on the screen, what would that code look like?
@app.route('/world')

**If I create a new application and import testingflask.py (a.k.a. I am not running it directly), will code under the ‘if __name__ == “__main__”: be executed? Why not?
ANS:No,"__main" inidicates to be run from current module ,if we want to run from some other then it's name has to replace __main__
